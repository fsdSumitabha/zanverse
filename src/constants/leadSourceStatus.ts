/**
 * Status of one lead source, the result of the latest call to it.
 *
 * Each status covers several things that can happen on a call. The note on
 * the status change says which one it was. Not Reached means no one
 * answered. Call Back, Interested and Not Interested mean someone did.
 *
 * Simpler than LEAD_STATUS on purpose. There is no pipeline and no order.
 * Any status can follow any other, except CONVERTED. Only the convert route
 * sets CONVERTED, and nothing changes it afterwards.
 *
 * `closed` statuses drop out of the working views (Today, Upcoming, No day).
 * They stay in Closed and All.
 *
 * 60 was Wrong Number. It is now part of Not Interested. Do not reuse 60,
 * because an old database can still hold it.
